1. GTK2
=====

1.0. Installation
-------------
Open ""Gnome-Panel -> System -> Preferences -> Theme" and drop the .tar.gz into the Theme Preferences window.


==========
2. Gnome-Panel
==========

2.0. Installation
-------------
By default the Gnome-Panel will not look very good. You have to assign a panel background image yourself.

1. Right click the panel and choose "Properties".

2. Open "Background ->Background image" and choose the provided "panel.png".

2.1. Gnome Menu icons
--------------------
To use the provided Gnome Menu icons ("start-here-apple.png" or "start-here-gnome.png") you need to use the panel menu type that does not have the "Applications Places System" text. The new icon will look best at a panel size of 23 pixels.

1. Right click the panel and choose "Add to Panel". 

2. Add the "Main Menu" item. You should get a panel menu that has only an icon (no text). 

3. You can remove the previous menu by right click and "Remove From Panel"

4. Open "Gnome-Panel -> System Tools -> Configuration Editor"

5. Navigate to "apps/panel/objects".

6. Find the "object_" entry where "object_type" is equal to "menu-object".

7. Check "use_custom_icon".

8. Set the value of "custom_icon" to the path of the icon. It should change as soon as you set the path.

2.2. Search icon
-------------
Create an Application Launcher for the search tool you want to use, e.g. "gnome-search-tool" or "beagle-search". Select the "system-search.png" as icon and place it on the right end of the panel.


=======
3. Metacity
=======
The Metacity themes comes in two versions. One has OSX style buttons and the other has regular.

3.0. Installation
-------------
Open "System -> Preferences -> Theme" and drop the .tar.gz into the Theme Preferences window.

3.1. Title bar buttons
------------------
For left sided window title-bar buttons (Mac style) go to:

1. "Gnome-Panel -> Applications -> System Tools -> Configuration Editor"

2. Open "apps/metacity/general" and change "button_layout":

Right-sided (Windows style):

==========
4. Beryl-Emerald
==========
The Emerald themes comes in two versions. One has OSX style buttons and the other has regular.

4.0. Installation
-------------
Import to Emerald Theme Manager.


==========
5. Program Fixes
==========
Here are some fixes for common problems using the Cobra theme package. (Or any dark Gnome theme for that matter).

5.0. Firefox
----------
If web forms and controls appear dark and unreadable you need to add the provided file "userContent.css" to the "chrome/" subfolder in your Firefox profile. It contains settings to get the default colors back. Put "userContent.css" in your home directory and type the following in a terminal:

  mv $HOME/userContent.css $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/chrome/

Note that the place of this directory may vary on different Linux distributions.

Restart Firefox and you should have standard colours.

5.1. Gaim 2
----------
To make Gaim use white fonts in conversations instead of the normal black, type the following in a terminal:

1. gedit $HOME/.gaim/prefs.xml

2. Around line 364 (probably) change the line:

  <pref name='fgcolor' type='string' value=''/>

To:

  <pref name='fgcolor' type='string' value='#FFFFFF'/>

Save the file. (restart Gaim if it's running)

5.2. Open Office 2
---------------
To get a white document background color instead of black, go to:

Tools > Options > OpenOffice.org > Appearance > Custom Colors > Document background

For dark themes Open Office 2 uses a high contrast icon theme (due to automatic icon settings). If you don't like this, do the following:

1. Open "Tools -> Options dialog -> OpenOffice.org -> View"

2. Change the icon theme from automatic/null to a different one.


5.3. Ubuntu
----------
If you are using Ubuntu and buttons look wierd, it's necessary to install the package "gtk2-engines-pixbuf‚Äù. Type in a terminal:

  sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf

The same is valid for all the themes based on the engine "pixmap".
